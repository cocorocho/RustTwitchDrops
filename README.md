    - **Rust Twitch Drops**

        When there are drops for Rust, streamer list will be automatically loaded.

    - **Other games**
        
        If you want to use the bot to collect drops for other games, you will need to use `user_defined_streams.json` file which can be found in the directory.

        Open the file and add URLs for streams.

        Example:

            user_defined_streams.json

            [
                "https://twitch.tv/foo",
                "https://twitch.tv/bar"
            ]
